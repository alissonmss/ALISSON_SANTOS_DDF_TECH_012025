## Item 1 – Dataset Selection and Description

### Dataset Description
For this technical case, the **NYC City Taxi Trip Records** dataset was selected. This dataset is publicly available and contains detailed information about taxi trips performed in New York City.

### Dataset and Volume
The NYC Taxi dataset contains **millions of records**, therefore fully complying with the requirement of containing more than **100,000 records**, as specified in the case instructions.

---

### Domain Representation
The dataset represents the **urban mobility and transportation domain**, allowing analyses related to operational behavior, temporal patterns, and revenue distribution. This makes it suitable for demonstrating an end-to-end analytical data workflow within the proposed scenario.

This dataset was selected among the examples suggested in the case description.
